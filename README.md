# TV Tracker for Personal Use

> API used:

Due to the complex nature of the request body in iOS shortcuts, I have created a custom interface to handle requests and send them to TMDb and Airtable.

## Some Side Notes

- [important] The app is designed for personal use, so it's not user-friendly.
- Some features can be used even without exactly same table settings in Airtable as mine: search TV shows, ... more to be added
